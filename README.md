# Project 1: A Transfer Learning on the Stanford Dogs Dataset

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to train neural network models to predict dog breeds through transfer learning, combining deep learning models with CNN architectures as their base.

## How to Run
To run the code directly, visit this Kaggle link:

The given `.ipynb` file already includes code for downloading and extracting the dataset. Simply run the first cell to do this.

## Train
The notebook is designed to run sequentially. The sections "Build Data Generator" and "Utility Function" are required to start the training process.

The 'Training Params' section is where hyperparameters are applied and the final layers of the models are fine-tuned. Each model has this section.
